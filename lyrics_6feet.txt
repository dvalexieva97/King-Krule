Title of song is: "Easy Easy",
 
[Verse 1]
Well same old Bobby, same old beat
Well yeah they got nothing on me
The same old cars, same old streets
But yeah they got nothing on me
And easy come and easy go
Well yeah I'm sure I told you so
Well they just want you for your dough
Man I'm sure I told you so
And with your dead-end job
That's been eating away your life
You feel a little inside
The trouble and strife
And now you spend your evenings
Searching for another life
And yeah I think, mate
I think you've got them in your sights

[Chorus]
Well, easy easy
There's no need to take that tone
Well easy
I'm on the telephone
Man just leave us alone

[Verse 2]
Ow no I should've kept my receipts
Cause the sandwich I bought
Yeah it's been off for a week
And 'low Tesco's stealing my money
When positivity seems hard to reach
I keep my head down and my mouth shut
Cause if you going through hell
We just keep going

[Outro]
You're easy, so easy
You're easy
Man just leave us alone
I'll be one minute on the phone

Title of song is: "Border Line",
 
[Verse 1]
You know I tried so hard
My feelings just can’t discard
The way in which I fell into
Your heart was never what I once knew
Lately my skull has kept
Dividing lines deep set and paved
Two paths too wander through to depart
And sever desires to pursue

[Chorus]
And the soul chokes
To cause the tide
To enforce divide
This whole devotion has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion to con the mind

[Verse 2]
See here I trace my steps
To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush
This slowly seeping straight through the crust
Now let these stains of gunk slip down
To where my head once sunk and drowned
Just await for a while to see
My body has merged to the deep krule sea

[Chorus]
But my soul floats
Adrift thoughtless minds, distorted lines
The soul is broken down, borderlines
To cause the tide, to enforce divide
This whole devotion has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion and con the mind

[Outro]
So scorn divine and mourn the pride
The cold has spoken, draw the line

Title of song is: "Has This Hit?",
 
[Intro]
What you doing man? I'm recording...

Another disappointed soul
Well I tried, I tried to keep it in control
Well I, I will end up on the dole
It's my life, and I'll fall into that goal

And well Blue you've got me on the go
But don't worry, you'll never know
And your eyes, they're never cold
To me, well at least, that's what I've been told

And girl, you made my dreams come true
It’s all a clue, that it was all for you
My self is still waiting in queue
It’s all that I, well all I want to do

I know when I look into the sky
There is no meaning
Girl I’m the only one believing
And that there’s nothing to believe in

I’m dreaming
My aspirations got a ceiling
Well I’m constantly cleaning
The scars of your dealings

And well my guts are on the floor
For you to adore me
And all that I could be
And see, girl, what I say
On the horizon
The skies are grey
The skies are grey

Has this hit?
Has this hit?

See girl I wish it hit
You know I wish it hit
You see I’m tired every night
See things never seem quite right

I’m never fully content
I wish it worked and went well for once
But if you’re a cunt and people are cunts

They pull stunts to stunt your progress
But know it’s slow to digest
The way your insides stress
You’re not blessed
You’re definitely not blessed

I don’t deserve history repeating itself
I always see myself getting picked up and left back on the shelf
Again and again and again and again

You're not my pen
You're my paper
You're not my heart
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker
You're its breaker

Title of song is: "Foreign 2",
 
[Verse 1]
Well see I never even stretched her faith
This storm would not allow it
As you observe it falls out of place
The time was born around it
I know it calls when you’re bare
Stripped from the mould
Well I stare sometimes and it tears away
With your soul
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
By suffering here in sovereign fear
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
But suffering here

[Chorus]
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

[Verse 2]
Now watch me burn alive as your thoughts deprive
All I know that’s inside
See I was torn by a skunks hand
And now they watch me crawl
See I was born by a young man
And now I’ve lost it all

[Chorus]
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

Title of song is: "Ceiling",
 
[Verse 1]
I endure stroking my head on the cranes
Well now they alone are all just one in the same
Demean and try to walk about
Among stolen signs that talk about
A passion that lies, well easy now
Maybe I was found
Just bathed in doubt

[Verse 2]
I’ll scan a different coast
Where my blame can lay and roast
In the heat of my own treason
Just as another pavement toasts
I remain aware of those
When consumed to paths of reason
Now do you stew your lovers croak to the glue of your own throat?
When the scenery starts peeling
And the scenery starts peeling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling

[Outro]
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling
This is the final line I wrote
When applying a final coat
That would bring down the walls
Well easy now, easy now
Maybe I was found
Just bathed in doubt

Title of song is: "Baby Blue",
 
[Verse 1]
My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl I could've been someone to you
Would have painted the skies blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 2]
Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl I've got no chance
And nothing to say
Girl but stay here for a little while
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last baby

You are my baby
You are my baby

I was your slave, can’t you see?
I was your slave, can’t you see?

Bobbing on the problem
On the problem, on the throbbing
She was falling, I was bawling
My heart was stopping, she was throbbing

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Cementality",
 
[Chorus]
See, the cement has never meant so much
My hot head cools to the stone cold touch
I look to settle my seed with the dust
Brain, leave me be, can't you see that these eyes are shut?

Enter my bed through that window
I hit zero
As guiltless loveless sins flow
Through me, you threw me
I descend smoothly
My concrete bed beckons
Can you hear me?

I was born in seconds
Do you fear the
Way you steer me
Towards the ground?
No, no, no I was never scared
Pain, had made my vision impaired
But now I'm free of care
See, life isn't fair, then at least death's there

To hold both hands
And stroll through lands
And as it stands
The empty vessel of a man
Can't be moved
It's not the cracks or the grooves
But the pavement soothes
The pavement was soothing
My body wasn't moving

Brain was buried deep beneath the ground
Fears would drown
The pavement is soothing
My body wasn't moving
Pain was buried deep beneath the ground
As fears would drown

[Chorus]

Title of song is: "A Lizard State",
 
[Verse 1]
I don't care about sunny days
Gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
I'm gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
It's gonna be like this
And that's alright
And that's okay
Is that okay?
Myself would beat these lines
In my head I'm getting dead tired of this shit you've caused
You fucking bitch
You don't know when to stop
You're a bunch of fat bitches, you motherfucking fat bitches
Fat bitches!

[Pre Chorus]
Well I don't wanna be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna fuck things over 'cos that's a start
Well if I can't have her then no one can

[Chorus]
Oh, but baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue, and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same

[Verse 2]
There was not much that I could do
Oh, not much that I could do
(Trapped in a lizard state!)
Well I got everyone on my back
But I'm not gonna crack like you cracked
You're a fucking pussy boy
Sipping up on my humblepie
You got no legs to get you near my height
So don't try and get near my hide
Don't try and get out the way yeah
I see what you gotta say
I hear your lizard state
If that's okay and if that's not okay
Say girl now what's okay

[Pre Chorus]
Well I don't want to be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna make it clear and girl I'll tear you apart
From the inside to the out

[Verse 3]
But baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same
But girl what was I supposed to do?
Yeah I was so hung up on loving you
And girl believe me this is something new
‘Cause all I will do
Is girl whatever I have to do
They all knifed me in the back and girl I can’t believe
It’s slipping away like that

Title of song is: "Will I Come",
 
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

[Verse 1: King Krule]
Well, if only
I had a heart to rip into
Because you owe me
A breakdown that would not include
Not to stay around
And see this night through
Girl, don't stay around
And bathe with me in blue
Just one of those things
Just one of those things
So i let you know
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

[Outro]
"In God’s name think what you’re doing"
"No! Jesus Christ! Oh my God!? No, no dear God, no, Christ!"

Title of song is: "Ocean Bed",
 
It's gone alright
Well soak it in
I mean this sponge side
Was coated in
The warmth of your tide
They're breaking in
I'll cross my coastline
It's what I'm waking in
To find heaven
It's bled into my bed
And I'm drifting away

Victor walked out into the High Street
Victor walked to the edge of town
Victor came to the trash heaps
And his tears came tumbling down
He cried

Are you in heaven, father?
I need you so
Have you melted yet lover?
For reasons unknown
You're sweet like no other
This haze has a warm hold
It radiates me undercover
Free your burdened soul
That's bled into my bed
And I'm drifting away

Neither of us remain
Neither of us remain
So let my waves take what I adore

Swept away
And off the shore
Neither of us remain
On the floor
I know you want this
More and more
So let my waves take
What I adore

Title of song is: "Neptune Estate",
 
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside

Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'll hold you tight
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I hope you feel used
And cope the way you do
Should conjure up abuse
Select your loss, slip to lose
Just to get the muse
There's no new news here
This world, it doesn't hold a fear
This girl, she doesn't hold a tear in my head
The brain lives on but the vibes are dead
Corrosively tread through emotionally spoon fed purpose
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless

I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'd hold you tight
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Some cats flee to see
On the lap of deceit
When true blue love means
This faithful dissolve
This melting control can be solved
The soft touch, the hopes, the souls
To one another, dear lover
Dear brother
Dear brother
Cause there's still life to be lived in hell
Can we lose our emotions and still live well?
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways

I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind

Title of song is: "The Krockadile",
 
See my eyes can't see clear
Cause their coated in fear
Shut down the left hemisphere
And it sent me here to abort

My intentions of thought
Or of thoughtful cause are no more and no less
See over there
There’s a storm in the west
Before it gets the best of me
This stress will be eased if you undress

But I think no less of your soul
See how it grows cold
I need to evoke before I lose control
Of my emotions

I don't want you to see
Soul drown in the ocean
With my body is spread across the city

You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Girl I can’t see my eyes

Are they open wide
Or shut dead tight
I know you are all fake
Cause man I'm the same
Well burn at me at the stake
Are you content with this game?
Are you content with what you've made?

And when there was days of dark
Were you witness when I was torn apart
By my own hands and my own heart?

Let me tell you girl
There’s no room to leave a mark
See it’s all just fine if you think it’s okay
When in actual fact you think it’s great
What can I say?
What’s there to say?

Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine
This ain't a sign if you think it’s okay
It’s just divine, but what can I say?

Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine

I can’t see my eyes
This is no vice
This is no vice
Can’t see my eyes
It’s what was advised
By the love of my life
Bathed in the core of strife
And it was born inside

My urge to purge is so bold
I need the warmth of a brother to hold
I need the warmth of your mother to hold me down
So hold me down
Can you hear that sound?
It came from six feet beneath this ground

Let me lay here
Girl let me lay here
For a little while I’ll obey fear with style
You see these eyes
Man they sense the light
That could be near
Can’t see my eyes
Can’t see my eyes

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Out Getting Ribs",
 
[Verse 1]
And hate runs through my blood
Well my tongue was in love
But my heart was left above
I’ve got to be leaving now
I thought I’d never be shot down
But girl I’m black and blue
So beaten down for you
Well I’m beaten down in bloom

[Chorus]
Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away

[Verse 2]
And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well I had no chance to get away
I can’t escape my own escape
Even more when it’s sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh but girl just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well take my crown again
He’s submerged in doubt

[Verse 3]
But wait, I make my last request
See this could be the best
But blue I need to rest
See I been broken down
So much has lost it now
I just stop and say
Girl don’t you worry ‘bout a thing
Baby, blue

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Bathed in Grey" 
[Verse 1]
What is there to say
When in front of you there lays
A strong path that paved your way
Now shattered lost shades of grey
I guess I missed her
This overgrown sister
With no cement in the mixture
Well let me paint this dark picture
They weren't men
They were duds
There was blood
Fed and thugs wed her calm heart
And now she’s laying in the dark
In a pool of filth
I found a body in the dark
I found her body in the dark

[Chorus]
I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say

[Verse 2]
We all find a day
To slip away
You pour your heart, your aching soul
Where I stay bold
Look for the times you took to hold
My naked soul
Deep sea diver
Born skiver
Two month fiver
I’ve hurt everyone but you
I see things simple
But it only rekindles
These dark shades of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue

[Chorus]
I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say

[Bridge]
It hasn’t hit me in the same way
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much else to say
It hasn’t hit me but I still feel the pain
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much more to say
Has this hit?
