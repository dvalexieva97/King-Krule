Title of song is: "Swell",
 
[Intro]
A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
A new place to drown

[Chorus]
Well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck my mental health
It went down the drain as well
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell
You just swell, you just swell, you just swell

[Verse]
I start to lose control
Argh shit, now what have I done
I may have fucked away the only true one
The true girl under the sun
Piercing in and out of life
Oh how you live it free
This tiny eye, it cannot see things
Simple, lies and deceit
Yeah, they still live with me
Girl you budge for this simple [?]
Why'd you budge for this simple [?] , girl

[Bridge]
A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
A new place to drown

[Chorus]
See well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck my mental health
Went down the drain aswell
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell, girl
You just swell

Title of song is: "Arise Dear Brother",
 
[Intro]
One, Two

[Verse]
We shall get together when the day is done
Rise to the moon, and set with the sun
You don't have to rush my pace, I always come
I think you're the one
But wait, there's some trouble with my mother
You know, I would rather be with you, lover
But sometimes she goes wrong
She needs a helping hand to stay strong
Even though you fucked him, I don't really give a shit
Maybe cause of my absence, you say it gives you the slip
To slip, you slipped and slide
Let this guy inside what I thought was mine
That night she lied, girl it reminds me of why
She's not my kind
Damn that slippery slime
Came back to hold me sometime
Another week I feel weak
Pretty sure I'm dying, as I speak
No prophets I seek
I told her all of this and she didn't feel sorry for me
When we meet, am I me
A blue moon midnight treat
And in the aftermath I can't sleep
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete

[Outro]
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)
You could complain, but I like to keep discrete
(It was all stuck together)

Title of song is: "Ammi Ammi",
 
I'm fine
That's blood upon my [?] I close my eyes
And I see you smile upon the...
Boys and girls, the Lord is the one who gives us new life and He's doing...

Lonely, I slowly slip into a pool of gold
She takes my hand and doesn't let it go
I feel it deep within my soul
Her whisper resonates my bones

I'm slowly hit and I slowly drift away
This [?] consumes me...
Well she's the type I carry by my side
Keeps me balanced, keeps her talons in my thigh
Reminds me of the damage of how I live my life
Keeps my salary damaged, hanging from the line
Her love's unlimited, she lays there playing Barry White
Girl, she plays me Barry White
All night as we drift into the light

We just smoke and let days roll by (just roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night (all night)
We just smoke and let things roll by (just roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night (the days roll by)
We just smoke and let days roll by (days roll by)
We don't care whether day or all night
We just smoke and let days roll by (days roll by, days roll by)
We don't care at all, girl
Hey
We just smoke and let things roll by
We don't care where whether day or all night
We just smoke and let things roll by
We don't care

Title of song is: "Buffed Sky",
 
Yeah she rolls (him) back
About 4 a.m until I know that
3 a.m, we chat, she thinks I know jack
Shit its been a while since I spat in this pit
Saw the worry on her lips
Yeah I wrote that
She's pinging on some dizz
Guess I owe her luck to that
But her eyes are still in lid
And her brain is still intact
She's swings solo
Yeah  Should I reinstate that
She's been knocked up days with a strange pack
She's looking for a guy who's more than laid back
Know to hold him tight
The ride's by J.D. Salinger
Well she likes my sense of a job (?)
The way it holds her
Lanky piece of shit
But she don't know that
Her man is round the corner with a chrome bat
He wants to knock my head in
Hear my bone crack
So I stay solo
Yeah, I'll fly solo
Oh I'll swing so low
Yeah we st(?)ing so low

Title of song is: "Sex With Nobody",
 
We're here to help. Catching canaries is all part of the job. Those of you who are way ahead of me could say something about a bird in the hand being worth two in the bathroom or something. She's grateful, of course. Very grateful, and invites me to stay for tea and a bit of cake. What would you do?

Never got along with many heads
Never got along with feds
Couldn't sleep in girls' beds
Had to fled
After I fuck and after I bust
I had to duck, get the night bus home
Now I'm getting a bus home
Stumbling home
Wandering home through Holloway Road
She wants me to do...

What would you do?

Man I got too much respect for you, baby girl
We don't have to do that right now
I mean it'll be fun, but when the sun comes up
Man I think to myself, "Whatever have I done?"
I'm like fuck, I got a little lick of luck
A lot of girls I lick, man they have to get

Somethings don't ever change
He had the same batch since his feet were bound in kickers
Creating unknown brothers, and unknown sisters
Locked in blood, gunk, fluids and mixtures
Of sweat, grease chicken, beef and love leaking stitches
Learning his citizenship he paints naked pictures
Earned to give her a tip
She waits on him but he's drifted
She took his eye and now his brain's gifted
A relaxed marriage on an island in the South Pacific
Bow
Some men are dogs to be specific
Some men are dogs to be specific

Closed all over when thoughts got explicit
He turned off the paper cause he read a seedy snippet
Perverse scum, their tongues stung and twisted
They remain in fine light but you know they're devils, and they're not with it
For us, they ain't with it
Uncovering these tales are horrific
Some men are dogs to be specific
Some men are dogs to be specific
Some men are dogs to be specific

Some men are dogs to be specific
Some men are dogs to be specific
Some fucking men are dogs to be specific

Title of song is: "Eye's Drift",
 
[Intro]:
"Oh, that's fucked up"
(That's fucked up)

I design my trip
In a frame of mind my [?]
I divide my spliff
Last night and intertwined with [?]
She defines my exist
Put a cigarette and divided her lips
She walks by, she’s pissed
She caught me on the corner getting higher than a bitch

My my my shit
[?]

Title of song is: "The Sea Liner MK 1",
 
Yo I‘d be glad to drift some more
But I‘ve a plan to hit the shore
These distant lands they need a hand to be explored
She writes to me but does not come abroad
That‘s why I guess she can‘t be my broad
I love her so but she‘ll get bored
Across this planet I'll explore
She said my Spanish was so poor
I only know few words I need to learn some more
A Peace signs plan to close the doors
Way up high behind the sense of thought
Alone well I thought
Caught in this acidic downpour
Is about ???? the combat is a different type of war
They raise the bar to exasperate the poor
They raise the bar and close the door
I must be from the North
I must be. Bah!

Title of song is: "Empty Vessels",
 
Girl there is nothing to please
Can't you just lay by my side
Isn't it easy to see
How I'm mistaken, my pride
Must be somewhere else
When this whole world
Under 1000 degrees
Baked till the earth was alight
Cowards who run to the sea
Just leaving me burning alive
With this whole fucking world

And if you don't know just how
This place came to burn and sink down
With hot lead already buried in my crown
They melted us down
I must be from some kind of worth

And if you don't know just how
This place came to burn and sink down
With hot lead already buried in my crown
They melted us down
Must be from out of this earth

Play your games
And other things
Little things go wrong with the world
Play your games

This slumped slacker seen better days
His lovers parted lips had parted ways
She still had a vital part to play
Looking for that darker shade
Picking up, bathed in his aftershave
He wants to be discreet
But can't help feel the mark he placed
Upon his head, the masquerade
Yo he can be seen in the masquerade
Girl he can be seen from these darker days
He can be seen from the masquerade
Girl he can be seen from these darker days
He can be seen from these darker days
He can be seen

Title of song is: "New Builds",
 
[Verse:]
The long courier makes haste to end
To give us night
He was concerned with the buildings
He was concerned with the gardens
Dealings of all of this, of all of this
I guess you did it to me, I guess you did it to me
You got me down
Whatever you do to me
What did you do to me
You got me down
What you do to me
I guess they did to me
You got me down [x2]
You got me down (you got me down)
If you did to me, I guess they did to me
You got me down
I guess you did to me
Whatever you do to me
I guess they did to me
I guess you do to me
You got me down

Title of song is: "Dull Boys",
 
[Intro]
She don't see me
She don't see me
She doesn't see me
She don't see me for what I am

[Chorus]
I've lost all my dignity
She don't even mean that much to me
I don’t even know 'bout this
Family tree we’ve been spreading
Across the south east, girl I-
Her heart doesn’t owe anything to your dignity
Please

[Verse 1]
We must've lost that moment when we felt connected
She reaches for the phone
Well now she planned her exit
See, somewhere along the line
She must've felt disconnected
Seeing those shallow eyes of mine
Might've been too well expected
What can you expect kid?
But her (my) body I don't know
I haven't felt much in a long time
I just might as well see how it goes
Spent a while I've been on my own, girl (girl)

[Chorus]
I've lost all my dignity
She don't even mean that much to me
I don’t even know 'bout this
Family tree we’ve been spreading
Across the south east, girl I-
Her heart doesn’t owe anything to your dignity
Please

[Outro]
She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me ever
She won't forget me forever

Title of song is: "Thames Water" 
I don't make money off it anymore
He said, reaching for the pile of scores
I offer no remorse
Man sat at the bar waging his wars
Onto the cats enjoying their main course
And I guess these speakers help ignore
Bartender knows all my floors

She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
My blood is good

She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows
She looks as if she knows

When it rains it fucking pours
Sky opens its mouth and spits to the floor
Soakin' all of us scum to the core
She spent every day escaping thought
Cubicle girl scrambles on all fours
She lost her powers in the powder she adored

Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like

Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losin' touch
Girl, this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Its got me losin' touch

When I found you things was right
These cunts will say anything just to get you with 'em
Who I am to mistakes that you can take to
Take your time to be playing the fool
But I'm not really with you

Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted on the border with war in our eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit

Girl this place is evil
Its lost its love with its people
Girl, its got me losin' touch
I think I'm losin' touch
I think I'm losin'

There's something in the water contorted her mind
Distorted in the border with war in her eyes
This inner city life treats me like shit, girl
Somethin' in the water contorted her mind
Distorted in the water with war in her eyes
This inner city life treats me so shit

Through this goddamn wind
She had everything
I've been top of the globe
[Blowing green round rings?]
We're watching pirate video
Somethin' fucks the screen
Take me over down the loco
Sipping crisps in the light with a zippo
And ooh is that the gold loco
Call my boy up just for a chill
He says he's no show
I guess it's just me and you
I guess I see my only note
I used to be on rainy days
Look outside my window
I see yellow skies
And I see purple in the [throat?]
I didn't even know where I was
Didn't even know what to do
Fruit Loops goddamn winds
At the top of the glow
I'm blowing green round waist
We're watching pirate video
Somethin' fucks the screen
Take me over to the loco
Said we could use a light we'll find something
Green eyes, icicles
I'm craving just one hit
And only have enough for one smoke
Getting tired of so much shit
I guess no one really knows
Cause I'm about the reefer
And the [?]

[Outro]
She looks so fine
She blows my mind I feel so high
I let her know
She just so fine
She blows my mind
