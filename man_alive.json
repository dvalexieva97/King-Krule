There's a television
There's a television speaking to me
There's a French girl
On my television
She's crying in the palm of my hand

In moving mental
I read the paper, or just the photos
I rip one out with my hand
There's a massacre
Across the o-, across the o-
Across the ocean
I can see it in the palm of my hands

Me hundo cada vez más hondo

Below the ground floor
We're losing signal, we've lost connection
I left her dying, she was still crying
And now she's lying in my head

Above the third rail, shrapnel flying
Next door's wobbling
But I'm riding to the end
What am I good for? (What am I good for?)
I've got no signal
Abandoned to the voice in my head


I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I-
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I-

Seeping through the bolts and cogs
Of these machines of fog

Another pair of eyes

Freeing from the battlefields
Young children with shields

I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to my mummy
Ain't allowed in the park
Exiled, couldn't even do one keepie uppie
The cars on my road almost hit me in a hurry
The cars are just a sign of another yuppie
Down in the dirt
I used to surf with my bucket from Kentucky
I had a scratch card, I scratched so hard
'Cause I'm feelin' fuckin' lucky, boy, I'm feelin' so lucky
On my tenth birthday, got a puppy
Now I'm back in the park with the middle class yobs
Tryna get lucky
I was little once more
Weed smoke made me feel so yucky
Pullin' on my brain, born
Another fuckin' junkie, born
Another fuckin' scum, torn apart
I was little once more, weed smoke, agh

I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy
Oh, I'm stoned again

My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to her, back to her
Down in a high
I used to pick up all the pieces and I went home
I used to pick her up
I used to pick it up

I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy"},

"Woke up, Peckham Rye at half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down
What happened to him in his past life?
What happened to him in his park side?
Roads were busy, buses passed by
I wonder who saw me, I was the last guy
Think it was Willem
He said I was headed in through the poolside
I hustled the cold keys 'til 5AM
But all I got was swept aside
Like the pesticide in your vegetables
It sounds like


Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times


Not again, it's Peckham Rye at half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down
What happened to him in his past life?
Spilled blood from his dome in his past time
Has it happened again? Is the skull slight?
Is the gold fine?
At least my nose ain't bent, but my brain's fryin'
Think they asked for a light, then they offered a line
Fought from some worst of men, but I'm glad to decline
Must've triggered somethin', enhanced masculine
And after I squish it in, self-esteem insulin


That contorts the glows at the worst times
It contorts the glows at the worst times
This contorts the glows at the worst times
It contorts the glow at the worst times (A waste of time)

Um, then, I'll be quick then
I've pinched a van off work tonight
I didn't, I didn't get an answer off you about the amp
I was seeing if I could just drop that
I don't know if your mum's in tonight or anyone
Just drop that 'round, if that's alright"},

Marching forth
I felt their warmth
Marching forth

And when I'm left alone
It's so damaging
And in this violence
The walls cave in
I'm not able
To escape it all

'Cause you're my everything, I have no words
And you're the only thing that makes life worth
Thought I had everything, but it's not worth
Thought I had everything

  "Take a dip, if you're alone, take your time
Take a ticket, take the train to the end of the line
See where you can go, you spent it, it's plastic, no do or die
Better flip it, think about it, you'll do just fine, well


These things will come and go
Deep in the metropole


Throw a stone, see it land, forget its flight
Draw a line in the sand between your thighs
Just to see which way you go
So you got this, you're the lead, feel your own
Battle through it, consume it, then let it go, girl


But don't forget you're not alone
Deep in the metropole


The ache and thunder in the storms of your mind
Soak it in, for the rain will pass in time
Nothing wrong in sinking low
You're the omen of paradise
You're the ghost they put aside


But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched
But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched

Another person for days
You're the only one
Who's held my gaze
And everyone must have left
I used to walk through the strange cold depths
Of the crane's cold stretch
That haven't seen the face


I dreamt I was here before
Above wet pavements
Across deep blue skies she would soar
Leaving her engravement
And everything sunk its stress
But for my drunken mess
And if the pain compress
Then it's something less to explain


I felt this fear before
I miss my best ailment
Bruising on my right side feels so
With thoughts of her displacement
And if there was nothing left
But for this strange deep rest
And the screams from my chest
Well, this heart's got no escape


And it all falls back into place
The prisoner's skull
The prisoner's brains
Were beat to a pulp
The dreams told me
I dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before
A cloudy view


I dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before
Must have dreamt I was here before
I dreamt I was here before"

How many of you are up there?
Perfectly above my head
With your cheeks on a chair
Some asleep
Some lit up by
Hollywood minds are clear
I feel the weight of the world go
I start my journey to and fro
Passport in my pocket's getting old
Feel the weight of the world dissolve

A deluge of the world flows
Ain't too easy to see when it's

For every word they had to say
Better off just leaving me this way
Better off just to leave it

How many hits can one bum take?
How many things can one boy make?

Chemtrails poke holes through commuters

Tin can flew off to Mallorca

The same show protested the order
From fifty foot, cigs blow smoke 'cross the border
To men that drowned holding their daughters
And weren't allowed refuge from the horrors
The instruction was mutual borders
I ain't felt this world and its orbit
