Title of song is: "Biscuit Town",

[Verse 1]
I seem to sink lower, gazing in the rays of the solar
In fact, we made a pact, but now I think it’s over
Red on white but he sipped on KA soda
Fuck, that's Coca-Cola, as TV sports the Olympic ebola
I think we might be bipolar, I think she thinks I’m bipolar
He left the crime scene without the Motorola
Still had dreams of being Gianfranco Zola
For at least for now, it’s all over
Yeah, at least for now, it’s all over

[Chorus]
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town

[Verse 2]
You're shallow waters, I’m the deep seabed
And I’m the reason you flow
I got more moons wrapped around my head and Jupiter knows
Whilst you orbit with some stupider hoes
Only a slacker would know tryna get up and group home
Tryna eat from the same bowl, in my troopers abode

[Chorus]
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town, ah-huh
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town (biscuit town)

[Verse 3]
And now I’m caught up by the taste in her mouth
As she whistles all about
She gonna miss her match deep down south
And no more wheelers dealers creeping about
At least none that she knows
Thrown away so much till I'm rolled up in the same old dutch
Need a touch of thought for my libido
And now she’s nearly hitting speed cones
As we proceed to her street dome, in her body not a weak bone
Strong mind, but she still got sight for a peep hole
Not that she knows, that’s what he knows

[Chorus]
In biscuit town, ah-huh
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
In biscuit town, in biscuit town
You best get down

Title of song is: "The Locomotive",

[Verse]
I’m not in the mood, but I gotta move
At least what I was hoping
The barriers stayed open
Now it’s just for the wait
And how unjust is this weight
My back was so broken
Tear me apart, pull me open
(Look inside) See the corrosion
The Tannoy spoke my name
This vessel was delayed
No objects in motion
A subject to smoking
The platform sighs, “My empty emotion”
As trackies walk on by
I’m alone, I’m alone
In deep isolation
In the dead of night, in the dead of night
Waiting for the train
In the dead of night I howl
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep calm
Curled up and feeble
Plagued by our brains, the internal sinking pain
I wish I was equal, if only that simple
I wish I was people (I wish)
The train it now arrives, I plead just take me home
Step the gap of minds, he steps the gap of minds
We all have our evils
We’re told just to keep cool
The soul of the people
I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal, I wish I was equal
Twist the soul of the people

Title of song is: "Dum Surfer",

[Verse 1]
Dumb surfer is giving me his cash
Won a bet for fifty and now I need a slash
Man this band that's playing, is playing fucking trash
Skunk and onion gravy, as my brain's potato mash
He came across the back of a bureaucratic stash
Shot the lot for credit and never got it back
He's mashed, I'm mashed, we're mashed
That cat got slashed in half like that
As venus completes orbit, I’m feeling slightly mashed
The stir fry didn’t absorb it, I need another slash
She spoke in English, it was low lit where we sat
Remembering her face but that’s the end of that
I’m a step from madness as I puke on pavement slabs
Got a bit embarrassed, need to get back to the lab
In the debts of traffic, I was feeling like we crashed
With a girl from Slovak in a European cab
From a set of habits, I can see momentums mashed
If we were commuting, this train would fucking crash
Now my brain's diluting with blame and guilt and hash
Getting lashed, getting lashed by all of the gods
By all of the gods, by all of the gods

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
As my brain's diluting, I suffer from whiplash
This girl's now screaming, I think we've gone and crashed
The driver’s speaking and the car is still intact
It was only minor, well that's the end of that
Girl, that’s the end of that as I know
Girl, some things you don’t know

[Outro]
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Dumb surfer, don't suffer
Ay, some things won’t change for a while
Keep me, keep me as the villain
But my prayer, you don't own

Title of song is: "Slush Puppy",

[Verse: Okay Kaya, King Krule, & Both]
Don't you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Nothing's working with me
Nothing's working with me
Don’t you dare baby, dare baby, dare
Face me already, replace me already
Don’t be scared, don’t be scared, don’t be scared
Deface me already
I’m a waste, baby
And I’m alone
So you come over
I’m down under sea
I’m down under
Nothing's working with
Me, nothing’s working
With me
I’m this worthless you see
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me
Nothings working with me

Title of song is: "Bermondsey Bosom (Left)",

Deslizando entre suciedad
A solas pero rodeado
Un nuevo lugar en el que ahogarse
A seis pies bajo la luna
Se levantó un chupasangre
Pintaba objetos en negro y azul con proyecciones de si mismo
Siempre fue sobre él mismo
Se sacude los adentros
Se le tuercen las tripas
Se sienta en la humareda y piensa en ella
Tú y yo contra esta ciudad de parásitos
Parásito, paraíso, parásito, paraíso

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Logos",

[Verse 1]
She smoked me whole and blows out Os
The sink had sunk, it overflows
The door is shut, my eyes are closed
I hear her moan or what I suppose
The thing about her, I must let go
Why I sing about her, she’ll never know
The bookie's shut, all bets are blown
The license bust, the shops are closed
I caught my mum, she stumbles home
Through open ground, back to broken homes
I thought about her, her smell through clothes
Her spoken smoke, mixed with my cologne
We were soup together, but now it’s cold
We were glue together, but it weren’t to hold
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved
Her solvents dissolved

[Verse 2]
The ups and downs, deep velvet folds
The landslides in, depression poles
Once thought was shed, but always holds
Reflection taunts my empty soul
The sky will weep on my way home
The bus won’t let me on, I’ll have to stroll
And in my head, tormented prole
As lies were fed, he swallowed whole
The soup was grey, intense charcoal
He molded clay at intervals
The lights would change, the same logo
I passed your house, it looked so cold
In dreams together, white noise arose
She draws me in and swallows whole

Title of song is: "Sublunary",

I was made for sublunary
I was made for sublunary
I’m not here, sublunary
I’m not here, sublunary
I’m not here
I’m not here, sublunary
I’m not here, sublunary
I’m not here, sublunary
I’m not here, sublunary
I was made for sublunary
And in shades of blue lunacy

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Lonely Blue",

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 1]
He slated life, was never alone
Lost his touch, encased head to toe
I'd save him but he's dead
She still hugs the cold night air
Still will search
The burdening city awaits
But he’s gone

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 2]
She thought about the flesh and his bones
Took a trip and called down the phone
I'd answer but I’m gone
My head's in all kinds of a mess
She takes it upon herself, concaves her chest
Now I'd be glad to see you
Now I'd be glad to see you

[Refrain]
Lonely blue, lonely blue

[Verse 3]
The blue cave, the deep dark unknown
Submerged forever soaked to the bone
She screams but she’s stone
Repeats my theory
Crawling through the dirt
From the deep dark, I wandered alone
So forlorn
Now I'd be glad to see you
Now I'd be glad to see you
In a ballad, we touch
'Cause our skulls will mush
So please don’t let go of our kingdom of trash (Ah!)
I got high off butane, I was born amidst a wrath
That boy, he's just a puke stain
That girl, she made me mutate, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, so lonely
Oh, so lonely
Oh, so lonely
So lonely blue
The sky was blue
And high above the moon was new
This eager heart of mine was singin', "Lover, come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me"

Title of song is: "Cadet Limbo",

[Intro]
Has it been this long?
Has it been this long since I saw you there?
Well, has it been this long?

[Verse]
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Lost to where I belong
I don’t ever wanna leave this night
And has it been this long?
Waltzing deep space lullaby
Well, has it been this long?
Lost paradise for one
I can see your face
Lost to where I belong
I walked across you everyday
As I floated along
Spent most of my time orbiting your waist
And had it really been this long?
Since I got lost in space?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?
Has it been this long since I’ve had this bond?

Title of song is: "Emergency Blimp",

[Intro]
No help still
No help still

[Verse 1]
He said it hurts when he stares at lights
I guess my brain was full, indecision's on the lefthand side
But the doctor said it's cool, just take these in the dead of night
Within the deepest sleep you'll fall
My head hit bed but my mind’s still alive

[Chorus]
These pills just make me, these pills just make me drool
I say these pills just make me, these pills just make me
These pills just make me, these pills just make me drool
I told him he weren’t doing things right
So he put me on some more, no change as a year flew by
I gave that fraud a call, he sniggered when I told my plight
He told me I was, he told me I was wrong
He told me I was, he told me I was
He told me I was, he told me I was

[Verse 2]
And now she's sat alone, the deep of night
She’s sitting in a pool
Makes incisions on the righthand side
Her blood is in me
Her blood is an assault
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in the song
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in me
Yeah, her blood is in the walls

[Outro]
Yeah, no help still
Yeah, no help still
No help still
No help still

Title of song is: "Czech One" ,

[Intro]
The train’s motion
Untidy echo
And she pants

[Verse]
She asked me why I’m here
But I come here every night
Do you need to tell her something?
No, I need a place to write
And as the sea of darkness forms
And casts us into night
You ask me what her name was called
But I found it hard to write
One time I was impaled forlorn
And thrown into a pile
I said you know where I’m coming from
And she looked me in the eye
Loverboy, you drown too quick
You're fading out of sight
Is it the numb density?
Can’t even look her in the eye
Where tiny men have been absorbed
For questioning the sky
To when and where the stars were formed
That glance upon this night
Light-years to sit upon
And paint us as we lie
And to think it's us she's wasted on,
Can't even look her in the eye
See I’ve found a new place to mourn
She asked me who died
Well if there’s a dark uniform
I need a place to hide
As simple as his faith had gone
The burning of the spire
And yet he still searched for warmth
But it was cold by the fire

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
She grips me tight, she grips me tight
But I still rip at the seams
I can’t sleep at night, never slept at night
But she still sits in my dreams
I’m out of sight, so out of sight
But she sees what I see
She's watching me
She's still watching me
She still sees what I see
The train’s motion
Untidy echo

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "A Slide In (New Drugs)",

[Intro]
Won’t be wasting my time
Won’t be wasting my time

[Verse]
I’m used to saying, “I don’t belong”
A burdened youth outcast from young
But how are you? I’m wasting your own time
And once consumed, spit gunk from lungs
To tell the truth, I haven’t done
But how are you? I’m wasting your own time
My skin is bleach, my hair is long
I have no teeth, I've never done
My gums are raw and bleeding all of time
The shapes are grey
The cityscape, bourgeoisie change to replicate
How can I be feeling the same as you?

[Outro]
'Cause they
Girl, they
Won’t be wasting my time
They, the suns will sinks
Won't be wasting my time

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Vidual",

[Verse]
She asked me in detail how to get to where I’m from
But I told her it won’t work
'Cause she needs to be raised in dirt
I saw some crimes when I was young and now my brain is gunk
Haven’t found the right sized sponge
To rinse through all its wrongs
I put my trust in many things but now I know that's dumb
So I don’t trust anyone, only get along with some
Saw that girl again one time and now I know it's done
And my eyes are so forlorn but her eyes are so full on
I watch her creep between the streets beneath the setting sun
I said hey, how, where you going with my gun?
See some boiling blood beneath my skin, I crave her tongue
As my head it starts to plunge so I follow where she’s gone
Kept me hollow by her side in a taxidermy skunk
Oh, my brain is for her junk, change and lipstick in my lungs
Left outside another night, I watch the city burn
Hear her screaming all her words I say baby it’s your turn

[Chorus]
And she keeps on, it’s one of the people, she gets torched
She's one of the people, she keeps on, as one of the people

[Verse 2]
She sits as dust, with an earthly pus in a capsule on my tongue
And I think of what we've done and sink into where she sunk
Now up on my mantelpiece, she has no legs to run
Still a trophy I ain’t won, in a ceramic pot for one

[Outro]
She scatters just like one of the people
And yeah, she scatters just like one of the people
And yeah, she scatters just like one of the people
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Bermondsey Bosom (Right)",

Slipping into filth
Lonely but surrounded
A new place to drown
Six feet beneath the moon
He arose a bloodsucker
Painting black and blue objects with projections of himself
It was always about himself
He jerks inside
His guts twist
Sits in the big smoke and thinks of her
Me and you against this city of parasites
Parasite, paradise, parasite, paradise

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Half Man Half Shark",

[Intro]
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark
Half man with a body of a shark

[Verse 1]
Half man with the body of a shark
Man, you know they left me in the dark for days
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it can stay
It was a corrosive touch, I just lost too much in my soul
Perhaps the emotive rush turned my brain to mush
I’ll never know

[Chorus]
You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

[Verse 2]
I’ll never know
Ah man, if you try and it works, well maybe it could stay
It’s the evoking trust holding this frame of rust, I had to let go
To let this place combust you must refrain from lust
Dismantle the throne

[Chorus]
You were so fine the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts, simples soft thoughts become menacing
Twisted raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body

[Bridge]
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to hide it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even aware
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
And if you don’t know and if you don’t care, don’t try to fight it
You’re not even there
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
Make it hard for us to understand
Brother, brother
I’ve only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
They make it hard for us to get together in this land
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Don’t try to hide it
Half man with the body of a shark

[Outro]
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, I’ll forever be alone
See world, you’ll never know
At least when you look to the stars they still glow
Well, not for me though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Well, I suppose I’ll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown, girl, I’ll forever be alone
They just don’t care

Title of song is: "The Cadet Leaps",

[Verse: King Krule]
Above and beyond all the rooftops
The space cadet waltz’ through the sky
Lost in his search for distant forms of life
Lucifer’s dream, no one could hold him down


Dumudulas sa dumi
Malungkot pero napapalibutan
Bagong lugar, para ba langgam
Anim na paa, sa ilalim ng buwan
Sumibol ang maninipsip ng dugo
Inipit ng mga laman-loob
Nakaupo sa malaking usok
Naisip ng lalake ang babae
Ikaw at ako, laban sa mga linta ng siyudad
Paraiso ng mga linta
Paraiso ng mga linta

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "The OOZ",

[Intro]
Hello?
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
Hello?
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolves
Of dust soft fuzz
Is anybody out there? Hello?
She pants, she pants
All I can see is her mouth
Is anybody out there? Hello?
Its motion, it's urgent, its trigger
Is there anybody out there?
Pulling us in, she pants
Is there anybody out there?
Distortion trails up spines
The locomotive has arrived
Is there anybody out there?
The locomotive has arrived

[Chorus]
I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Can we meet here?
Until the end of time

[Verse]
Is there anybody out there?
'Cause I'm all alone
In soft bleeding, we will unite
We OOZ two souls, pastel blues
Heightened touch from losing sight
Swimming through the blue lagoon
Basking in the dark of night
Of depths unknown to be explored
We sink together through the sky (the sky)

[Chorus]
I don’t know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Could we meet here?
Until the end of time

[Verse 2]
Is anybody out there?
A lover's sigh
To be absorbed
But I let go, I slip alone
Sorrow weeps my lucid eye (lucid eye)
Abandoned bodies by numb minds
The universe salutes, Lucifer cries
Within heartbeats, you strum goodbye
Within your heartbeats, you say goodbye
I don’t know why
Is anybody out there?
Could we align?

[Outro]
She pants she steals
Can’t you breathe
Through moans of the dead
The universe in skulls
As oceans stand still
Steel structures dissolve
She weeps
Her sweet sting
Bleeding perfume perpetually
It overflows, it sinks
It drips in obnoxious ink
On streets, in clothes
She leaps, she limps
Tense liquid herbivore
Cannibal pacifier
She pushes me off
It’s cold by the fire

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver)",

Bathed city

Bathed city

The liquid scenery
Cast an indigo complexation
To drift so carefree, moonlight reflects in the pool of darker times
And to sink to darker measures
Submariner seeks pride from depths hard to find, forever wading
A pool of strange things
Its guilt, is craving, this comfort, it’s quilt
And outside I think it’s raining

Why’d you leave me? Because of my depression?
You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson
Things are even
But don’t even out
The deep sea diver’s in doubt

*murmurs*
*murmurs*
*murmurs*

And if we swim down low
This pressure might go beneath the covers the cotton ceiling
And if we swim down low
This pressure might grow beneath city lights I’m wandering home
And if we swim down low
The pressure might go beneath the sheets I’m covered in
And if we swim down low
The pressure might grow those woes were still hovering

This day’s slipping
I feel my feet drift
Tarmac city skin
I walk the beat swift
The sunsets, the moon lifts
Those blue hours, those blue hours
Those blue hours, that blue shift

 ---------------------

Title of song is: "La Lune"

Sins will swallow explicit
Kinks of hollow mystic
That sit deep in a limp twitch
Turns a pale tanner
Handspan a hammer
Consults a cold manner
That lies deep in the grammar

Mono inner collision
Born to mid decision
Born bare invision
Just to master a sigh
They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry

Well I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with you
Cross the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
*murmurs*

Used heat cooling
Steady steeps falling
Brain keeps stooping to avoid
Thoughts of matter
Pristine platter replicates the flatter of a nervous crane
Some won’t understand and it my deplete a man
By seeping through the cracks of bland

They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry

See I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with a view
Across the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
Till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
To be with you, such a view
To be elevated to you
To be elevated to you
